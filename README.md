FAQ
------------------

**What do I have to do now as first steps?**  
  
SystemTrayMenu is portable so you do not have to install it.  
We would recommend to put the unzipped SystemTrayMenu folder into a folder like "Portable Tools" in the SystemTrayMenu root directory.  
  
1. After starting the application the first time you have to choose the root directory.  
C:\Cloudfolder e.g. Seafile, NextCloud or Dropbox\your folder with links e.g. Tools or SystemTrayMenu  
e.g. C:\Seafile\Tools  
In this directory you should put shortcuts of folders and files (App, Game, Script, URL, Network),  
which you are often using and especially when you can not find them over the windows start menu search.  
You can also consider to put there all files from your desktop.  

2. Move the SystemTrayMenu icon by drag and drop from the system tray into the taskbar below.
