FAQ
------------------

**What do I have to do now as first steps?**  

SystemTrayMenu is portable, so it does not need to be installed. After downloading e.g. SystemTrayMenu-1.0.17.24.zip, **unzip the folder**, then **start SystemTrayMenu.exe**.
If you prefer an installation there is the possibility to install SystemTrayMenu via the Windows Store.
  
1. Step: After starting the application the first time you have to **choose the root directory**.  
In this directory you should put shortcuts, files and folders (App, Game, Script, URL, Network),  
which you are often using and especially when you can not find them over the windows start menu search.  
You can also consider to put there all files from your desktop.  

2. Step: **Move the SystemTrayMenu icon** by drag and drop from the system tray **into the taskbar** below.

3. Step: Now it is ready to start - just **click on the icon** in the taskbar to open the SystemTrayMenu.
