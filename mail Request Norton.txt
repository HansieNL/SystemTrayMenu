Hello Symantec Team,

I am the owner/ developer of my software TAMAHO SystemTrayMenu  / systemtraymenu.exe

My software is a improved windows toolbar. 
Please find more informations on my website:
http://www.hofknecht.eu/systemtraymenu/
(There i am frequently providing updates during beta phase)

It not contains any other functionalities, no hidden doors.
My software exactly only makes what described on website.

Current version is 0.9.1.224
Later versions will be released under same homepage. Links look then like (current version):
http://hofknecht.eu/systemtraymenu/0.9.1.224/SystemTrayMenu-0.9.1.224-beta.zip

It will probably become Open Source as soon it is good enough ;)

A user reported, that Norton detects systemtraymenu.exe as unsafe and he needs to allow it explicitly.

Here my product clipboard:
